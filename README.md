# Blockchain Cluster Intelligence 🧩💡

## Introduction 👩‍💻
Hey, my name is Jazzy the Creator of this code! Take a look around!

## Background 🌅
Imagine a sea of over **19,000 cryptocurrencies**, each with its own unique characteristics and purpose. Blockchain Cluster Intelligence acts as your compass, harnessing the power of clustering algorithms to identify patterns and relationships within this vast digital ocean. By analyzing massive datasets, we can uncover hidden structures and connections,  empowering you to navigate the ever-evolving crypto landscape with greater clarity.

## Analysis 🔍
For the full analysis please see the details inside my code. For the shortend details and key findings please refer to the stats below ⬇️ : 
* Less features can be beneficial by reducing noise.
* PCA helps keep relevant features, but doesn't guarantee better results.
* K-Means initialization can also impact cluster formation.

## Happy Coding 🎉
